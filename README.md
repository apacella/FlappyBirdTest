# FlappyBirdTest

I DO NOT OWN THIS GAME!! 

This is being used as a learning experience but im adding my own twists to learn and grow in my new field. 

feel free to pull and take a look and even add your own items and assets, but the majority of the code and sprites can be found by using the link below 

https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/live-session-making-a-flappy-bird-style-game#5c7f8528edbc2a002053b6a7

it is outdated but was fun to learn and easy for those new to coding and/or unity.
